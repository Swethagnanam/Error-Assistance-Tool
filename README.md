# Error-Assistance-Tool
Team 12 SPD Project 2021

## Project Outline:    
This project has been developed keeping in mind day-to-day programmers and programming enthusiasts. It supports usersâ€™ by providing prompt error handling aid and management.
Stack Overflow, being the go to platform for programming related doubts, it can sometimes be overwhelming to ask the perfect question. And often we may revisit the same error, wherein keeping track of all these errors and managing them without the aid of an application can become cumbersome. The product was designed to address these issues.
This web application detects the errors in your code and searches for related existing questions on stackoverflow and displays those threads. It maintains a user's error history, gets feedback from users and provides FAQ( Frequently Asked Questions) for easy navigation through the website.
